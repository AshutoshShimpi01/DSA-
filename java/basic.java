Multiple Inheritance :-


Java doesnt support multiple Inheritance.
because-

class A
{

show();

}

class B 
{

show();

}

if class C extends A,B             // In class C Doesn't have show() method 
{

}
main()
{

C obj = new C();
obj.show();                      // At their which show method call in class A or Class B.  PROBLEM CREATE 

}

HENCE JAVA  doesnt support multiple Inheritance.
